# H.265

The device's factory-installed firmware is strictly provisioned without H.265/HEVC video encoding or decoding functionality.

Any user-initiated modification of the firmware, manual installation of third-party H.265 modules, or independent development of HEVC features constitutes an assumption of all related risks by the end-user. These risks include, but are not limited to, patent licensing fees, legal liabilities, device compatibility issues, and performance degradation.

The manufacturer expressly disclaims all responsibility for the operation, security, or legal compliance of any user-customized H.265 features.
